AuthFunc - You can define new ones // (Should return any relevant user info)

NewAuthFuncInstance - You can name and set a priority

NewAuthFuncList - You can group them with a name (all names must be unique) 
authFuncListCore.AddCallables - You can modify a list
authFuncListCore.RemoveCallables - You can modify a list
authFuncList.UpdateHandlers - after the list is modify, you can cycle all the handlers that are using it

NewAuthHandler - You can create a new handler
authHandler.GetBase (get the base http handler)
authHandler.SetBase (set the base http handler)
authHandler.AddInstances
authHandler.RemoveInstances

finish refactor!

look at race condition testing

What we can do: add and remove lists, add and remove instances from lists. But we can't change paths yet. That's almost more important. I guess I have no idea what I'm building. So it needs this first with config, then with GRPC. Uhh then I can do an implementation. It needs to save config too.

First implement it statically with julienschmidt/httprouter
Get your splash page up
Then fix auditmatic
Then implement a firewall
Then make sure that julienschmidt/httprouter is safe for concurrent write/reads
Then load it from config
Then modify config with GRPC (and add command line for this)- be able to write it and stuff


CONCEPTS:

Primitives:

AuthFuncs - these may be copied or may be pointed to, who knows. I guess it could get more complex if they're generated with closures (since the authfuncs may share memory)
Instances - a structure that contains the authfuncinstance. maybe it would be better if the authfunc was a receiver. that way, the authfuncinstance could be refered to... but then by multiple goroutines and it would need to be managed. generally these are write once, generated a new one if you want it.
Lists - Lists contain lists of instances. They can be modified at runtime. Therefore they should only be written by one person at a time. For a global list, we use a RWMutex, so you can read and write correctly. It could be better, it should be writes always get priority (ie multiple writes will occur in succession before reads- which is when it's copied/registered with funcs, which copy the lists so they don't suffer the RWMutex more than occasionally). Lists point to the handlers that use them, since if we modify the list we may need to go through the handlers. Therefore, if the handler adds the list, it should append it to the list. Here's the intractable issue.If we want the lists to be modifiable at runtime (which is why they are concurrency safe), we have to know
a) if we remove the list from the handler, the list/handler association is removed
b) if we add a list to a handler, the list/handler association is created 
c) if we modify a list, it's handlers need to be told to recycle
Note: we don't really want to reread the list anytime any par tof the configuration is changed, so it may be best to keep a pointer and a copy of the list.
So, there needs to at least be an instance for each list that is the "main" instance, the reference for any copies. So we can copy it into the handler or point to it. In the copy, we need to add the handler using it to it's list of handlers. If we remove it, we don't need to remove it from the list, because we can detect whether or not it's removed when we try to recycle the handler. In a way, the handler is subscribing to changes. That's fine because handler is pointer by default. Okay, so to have the hnadler access the "main list", we could use a map of global lists and give each one a unique name. I don't like that, but it would prevent pointers. Or we could point to the list. I think that's what we're going to do. But a map of pointers is bad. So you could reference them both by map, okee. 
Handlers - the handler uses a pointer, since it contains concurrency objects we want to prevent copies of. We avoiding any instance of pass-by-copy accidently since we're defaulting to a pointer. You'd have to do it intentionally..

TODO: 

build the profiler

TODO: Implement with fileserver, template, and proxy- seperate repo, private repo
TODO: one submodule for checking ips- do submodules have their own paths- their own ops. They need it, I think.
TODO: one submodule for just letting you in if you click a button
Your auth funcs might create sessions, they might check for sessions, they might just check for certain data. I'll write auth functions to check for IP, but also to check if a session is active, and if not let them log in, and then check to see if it worked out.

TODO: timeouts, especially because we might redo stuff
